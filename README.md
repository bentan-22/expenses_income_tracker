## Personal Finance Planner
This project was created as the second project for the course SEIF-SG-12 by General Assembly. I chose to create a personal financial planner to keep track of my expense and income transactions and convert them to any currency.

### Project Description
You can generate lists of expense and income transactions, with each transaction showing the amount, category, remarks (if any) and a timestamp. All the amounts can be converted to any currency using a third-party API key.

### How to Run the Project
Run 'npm start' after downloading.

### Technologies Used
The project was created with React and Redux, and styling was done with Tailwind CSS.

### Bugs / Fixes
No bugs at the moment.

### Possible Extensions
1) Be able to select individual transactions to be converted to other currencies, while leaving the non-selected transactions intact.

2) Add a savings component.

3) Better aesthetic appearance.

### Credits
I would like to credit Brad Traversy for his tutorial on YouTube on how to build an Expense Tracker using React Hooks and Context API: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XuFDcZABiDQ

This project is based on Traversy's YouTube tutorial and includes additional features which I subsequently added.

I would also like to thank my course instructors Leonard and Yudy, teaching assistants Yuyao and Kevin, and my fellow coursemates for their guidance and feedback in the creation of this project.
